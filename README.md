# ETL-Operations-on-Given-Data-
Provided two files containing sales data from two different regions. create a Python script that:
1. Extracts data from these above files.
2. Transforms the data according to the specified business rules.
3. Loads the transformed data into a database of your choice (SQLite preferred).
4. Writes SQL queries to validate the data in database.

## Running the Script:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have pandas installed: pip install pandas.
3. Place order_region_a.csv and order_region_b.csv in the same directory.
4. Run the script: python main.py.
5. The data will be loaded into: sales_data.db.
6. Use SQLite browser or run the provided queries.sql file to validate the data.

## Explanation of Steps:
### Extract Phase: 
1. Reads two CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. Adds a region column (A and B) to differentiate the regions.

### Transform Phase:
1. Combines both regions into a single table.
2. Adds:

        total_sales = QuantityOrdered Ã— ItemPrice

        net_sales = total_sales - PromotionDiscount
3. Removes duplicate OrderId.
4. Excludes rows where net_sales <= 0.

### Load Phase:
1. Creates an SQLite database..
2. Loads the transformed data into the sales_data table.

### Validation:
1. SQL queries:

               a.Count total records.

               b.Aggregate sales by region.

               c.Calculate average sales per transaction.

               d.Detect duplicate OrderId entries.

## Assumptions & Decisions:
1. The database used is SQLite.
2. Duplicate OrderId records are removed.
3. Invalid sales (net_sales <= 0) are excluded.
4. Total sales and net sales calculations use INR currency.
